It's an incredibly complex, yet robust substrate which can be continually molded through willpower and creativity. While the base organic model serves as a general purpose tool, I believe customization will ultimately pave the way for highly specialized functionality. The following are a few simple examples of the type of thinking which interest me.</p>

            <h4 class="ae-u-bolder">Deconstructed Mouse</h4>
            <p>The standard computer mouse is a universally familiar input device, but it's limited to use on generally flat surfaces. Trackpads offer greater mobility, but are confined by their fixed area. Is there a way of simultaneously maintaining the familiarity and accuracy of using a mouse while increasing device mobility and versatility?</p>
            <p>There are four main inputs to consider: tracking, left click, right click, and mouse wheel. All that's needed to collect these data are a CMOS sensor + light source and binary contact switches. In fact, the vast majority of a mouse's volume is dedicated to structural components. In a deconstructed mouse, the user's hand will substitute for these components. Mount a contact switch to the pads of the index, middle, and ring fingers. On top of one of the switches, attach a CMOS sensor with light source. Admittedly, this finger's components would be bulky, but I still think it would be manageable. All wires run along the fingers to a chipset on the back of the wrist, where there'd also be a battery and bluetooth transmitter.</p>
            <p>Using the device would be intuitive. Dragging the optical sensor along any continuous surface should be fine, e.g the regular weave of a pair of jeans would provide plenty of accuracy. Clicking is done by applying pressure to the corresponding fingers. The contact switch on the ring finger can serve as toggle to access extended functions such as mouse scroll, forward, back, etc.</p>
            <p>Immediate concerns include switching from mouse use to typing, but mounting everything on the finger pads should leave the tips free to interact with the keyboard. At least some sort of webbing system should be developed to manage all the wires and hold components in place. Depending on how extensive it is, donning and doffing the device may take longer than desired.</p>

            <p>Soldering is a tedious task. The sky is blue. Rent is due monthly...but maybe it doesn't have to be. I'm talking about the soldering bit that is. Even when using a helping hand to hold your components, alignment can be tricky, and no matter how you finagle things, you need at least two fingers to manipulate the solder.</p>
            <p>I think there's an easy way to get that finger count down to one. Mechanical pencils use a clamping chuck in conjunction with a retainer to hold the lead in place, so all we need to do is use the same mechanism while replacing the lead with solder wire and ta-da! Controlled wire feed. Mounting this contraption to the side of your index finger allows incremental feeding with the press of a thumb or custom shaping by using your other hand while the side lever is depressed. The index finger is extremely dexterous and should permit accurate application of solder while the other four digits of the same hand manipulate the piece.</p>
            <p>Careful not to burn yourself.</p>

              <h4 class="ae-u-bolder">Muscle Exertion Monitoring</h4>
              <p>Individual muscle fibers experience micro-tears when sufficiently stressed, stimulating the body's repair mechanisms to reform the fibers in a way that increases strength. This process is known as muscular hypertrophy. To repeatedly induce micro-tears, and thus muscular hypertrophy, the athlete must consistently increase the intensity of workouts to account for the additional strength gains from the previous hypertrophy cycle. At its core, strength training revolves around this concept of progressive overload. </p>
              <p>One repeated behavior I've noticed during workouts is that when muscles are under load, but can no longer physically lift the weight, they will shake with a distinct and repetitive pattern. This is a common symptom of muscular exhaustion and serves as an indicator of a productive workout. However, there are other times when I'll finish a set with relative ease and absentmindedly move on, never getting the full benefit of the workout.</p>
              <p>Perhaps there are benefits from integrating a combined EMG sensor and accelerometer as a wearable unit capable of detecting muscle exhaustion. When a threshold EMG signal and corresponding exhaustion vibrations are detected, an LED notifies the user. This physical transducer could be helpful in encouraging the user to push until the limit, or even prevent injury by discouraging another rep when the user is already exhausted.</p>
              <p>Additionally, a plethora of data can be logged after each workout by monitoring each EMG activation sample corresponding to a rep. With enough examples, meaningful patterns may emerge after unsupervised learning on the dataset. It would be interesting to see how the first and last reps of an exercise differ in their accelerometer patterns or how performing a squat looks versus a bench press. </p>
